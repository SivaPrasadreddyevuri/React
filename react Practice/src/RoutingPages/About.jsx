                Hi,I’m an eager web developer
                just starting out, with solid skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I
                enjoy building clean and responsive websites, and I’ve worked on
                several personal projects to practice these skills. I’m currently
                learning React and Node.js to become a full-stack developer. I love
                solving problems and collaborating with others. I’m excited to
                contribute to real projects and grow my skills as part of a creative
                team. Let’s build something amazing together!
